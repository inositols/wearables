## üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Deployment (Alternative)**

If you prefer manual deployment:

### Step 1: Build the App
```bash
# Install dependencies

# Build for web
flutter build web --release --base-href "/wearables/"
```

### Step 2: Create gh-pages Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to gh-pages branch
git checkout --orphan gh-pages

# Remove all files
git rm -rf .

# Copy built files
cp -r build/web/* .

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Flutter Biometrics Dashboard"

# Push to gh-pages branch
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Select **gh-pages** branch and **/ (root)** folder
4. Click **Save**

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

#### 1. **404 Error**
- Make sure the base-href is set correctly: `--base-href "/wearables/"`
- Check that your repository name is "wearables"

#### 2. **Build Fails**
- Ensure Flutter is properly installed
- Check that all dependencies are in pubspec.yaml
- Run `flutter doctor` to check for issues

#### 3. **Assets Not Loading**
- Verify assets are in the `assets/` folder
- Check that `pubspec.yaml` includes the assets section

#### 4. **GitHub Actions Not Running**
- Make sure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Check that you have push permissions to the repository
- Verify the branch name matches (main or master)

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Flutter installation
flutter doctor

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release

# Test locally
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080
```

## üì± **Testing Your Deployment**

Once deployed, test these features:

1. **Load Data**: Should show loading skeleton
2. **Range Switching**: 7d/30d/90d buttons
3. **Chart Interactions**: Hover for tooltips
4. **Dark Mode**: Toggle theme
5. **Performance Toggle**: Large dataset mode
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Test at 375px width
7. **Error Handling**: Simulated network failures

---

## üåê **Custom Domain (Optional)**

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository root:
```
your-domain.com
```

2. Update the GitHub Pages settings:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Add your custom domain
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

3. Update the workflow file to include your domain in the cname field

## üìä **Performance Monitoring**

Your deployed app includes:
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Error handling** with retry functionality
- **Loading states** for better UX

The app is optimized for:
- **<16ms per frame** rendering
- **10k+ data points** handling
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Cross-browser** compatibility
