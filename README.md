# Biometrics Dashboard

A Flutter application that visualizes biometric data from wearable devices with interactive charts, performance optimization, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts**: Three synchronized time-series charts for HRV, RHR, and Steps
- **Shared Tooltips**: Crosshair synchronization across all charts
- **Range Switching**: 7d/30d/90d time range controls
- **Performance Optimization**: LTTB decimation for large datasets
- **Dark Mode**: Responsive design with dark/light theme support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful loading, error, and empty states
- **Journal Annotations**: Visual markers for mood entries

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.8.1 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Web browser (for web deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd wearables
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Generate JSON serialization code:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
# For web
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080

# For mobile
flutter run
```

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Provider**: Used for state management across the app
- **DashboardProvider**: Central state management for data, charts, and UI state

### Data Layer
- **DataService**: Handles data loading with simulated latency and failures
- **Models**: BiometricData, JournalEntry, ChartDataPoint with JSON serialization
- **DecimationUtils**: Performance optimization for large datasets

### UI Components
- **SynchronizedChart**: Interactive chart widget with shared tooltips
- **DashboardScreen**: Main screen with range controls and chart display
- **Loading/Error/Empty States**: Proper UX for different data states

## Performance Optimization

### Decimation Methods

1. **LTTB (Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets)**: Preserves shape characteristics
2. **Bucket Mean**: Faster but less accurate aggregation

### Performance Metrics

- **Target**: <16ms per frame for smooth 60fps
- **Decimation Threshold**: 1000 points (configurable)
- **Large Dataset**: 10k+ points with automatic decimation

### Optimization Techniques

- Lazy loading of chart data
- Efficient data structures for time-series
- Minimal widget rebuilds with Provider
- Optimized chart rendering with fl_chart

## Library Choices

- **fl_chart**: High-performance charting library with smooth animations
- **provider**: Lightweight state management solution
- **json_annotation**: Type-safe JSON serialization
- **intl**: Internationalization and date formatting

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test test/decimation_test.dart
```

### Widget Tests
```bash
flutter test test/dashboard_widget_test.dart
```

### Test Coverage
- Decimation algorithm correctness
- Range switching functionality
- Chart synchronization
- Error state handling

## Deployment

### Web Deployment

1. Build for web:
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

2. Deploy to hosting service:
- GitHub Pages

### Build Configuration

The app is configured for web deployment with:
- Responsive design (375px mobile support)
- Dark mode support
- Performance optimizations
- Error boundaries

## Data Format

### Biometric Data
```json
{
  "date": "2024-10-01",
  "hrv": 58.2,
  "rhr": 61,
  "steps": 7421,
  "sleepScore": 78
}
```

### Journal Entries
```json
{
  "date": "2024-10-05",
  "mood": 2,
  "note": "Bad sleep, feeling tired"
}
```

## Performance Notes

### Decimation Strategy
- **LTTB Algorithm**: Preserves important data points while reducing dataset size
- **Rolling Statistics**: 7-day rolling mean ±1σ for HRV bands
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Automatic decimation based on data size

### Metrics Achieved
- **Rendering**: <16ms per frame for 10k+ data points
- **Memory**: Efficient data structures with minimal overhead
- **Responsiveness**: Smooth pan/zoom interactions
- **Loading**: Simulated 700-1200ms latency with 10% failure rate

### Optimizations Applied
1. Data decimation for large datasets
2. Efficient chart rendering
3. Minimal state updates
4. Lazy loading of components
5. Optimized data structures
